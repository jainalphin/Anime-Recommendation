# Anime Recommendation System
<center> <img src="img/anime.jpg" alt="Anime" class="center"> </center>
It is built on **content based recommendation** concept

Concepts on which system is built on:
   * unsupervised algorithm nearest neighbor.
   * This algorithm will find k nearest data point which will be the recommended anime to watch.
   * then I have used cosine similarity as the metric for the algorithm.

I have built the webapp using Flask and deployed it heroku.<br><br>
